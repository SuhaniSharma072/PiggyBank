My project PiggyBank aims to replicate a real life piggy bank, where you start with a balance of $0 and you can deposit or withdraw money or check your balance. I made this project to test out my java skills 
and to perform real math that is used in the financial world. I struggled with using conditionals to perform the specific action choices, but I eventually got the hang of it.
